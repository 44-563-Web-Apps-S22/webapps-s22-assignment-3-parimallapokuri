        <h1>Jathiratnalu</h1>
        <p>My favourite movie is Jathiratnalu which is a comedy movie. It describes about a group three friends how they come from village to city and <br>
        how they are struggled to get a job in city with tough competetion. That is why I like this movie very much.
